                The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating
                from San Francisco, California. The band
                consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist
                Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist
                Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The
                band achieved its first commercial success as
                an unsigned act, drawing attention from
                manager Cam Adams. Having worked with
                other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room,
                One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was
                confident the band could succeed even further,
                pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.
            </p>
            <p class="about__text">
                From there, the band has soared, gaining
                international recognition and ranking in the
                top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
                immediately fell in love with the band’s original
                and organic attitude, solidifying their place as
                one of the hottest and fastest up and coming
                acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
                themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to
                their candid and authentic performances on
                stage. Looking forward to touring in the future,
                The Bees Knees are currently recording their
                second studio album, looking to be released in
                late 2021.
